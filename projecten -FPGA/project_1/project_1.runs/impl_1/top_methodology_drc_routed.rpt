LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell SELECT_BUTTON/count2[0]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) SELECT_BUTTON/count2_reg[0]/CLR, SELECT_BUTTON/flag_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
